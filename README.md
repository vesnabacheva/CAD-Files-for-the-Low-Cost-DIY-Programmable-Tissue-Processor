This repository contains the CAD design files for the programmable tissue processor described in:

Low-cost, DIY programmable tissue processor for solvent exchange in biological sample preparation
May Wang¹,§, Samantha Pelletier²,§, Lexi Ellis³, Robert Shepherd¹, Margaret Frank², Abraham Stroock²˒³˒⁴, Anand Kumar Mishra¹˒⁵,, Vesna Bacheva²˒³˒⁴,*

📂 What’s inside

STEP (.step) and SolidWorks (.sldprt) files of all custom 3D-printed and machined parts.

Files are organized according to the major subsystems:

Glassware Tower — holders and adapters for the premix and tissue containers.

Control Box — housing for the keypad, LCD display, and Arduino Mega board.

Pump Module — mounting structures for peristaltic pumps and tubing routing.

Relay & Power Box — enclosures for relays, power converters, and wiring.

Miscellaneous Connectors & Fittings — hose barbs, adapters, and custom seals.

🛠️ Fabrication Notes

The CAD models were created in SolidWorks 2022.

Files are exported in STEP format for compatibility with other CAD software.

Recommended materials and print settings are provided in the manuscript (Table 2).

Most parts can be fabricated using standard FDM or resin-based 3D printing.

PLA or PETG is suitable for general use; consider chemically resistant materials (e.g., PTFE) for compatibility with non-polar solvents.
